Versioning
================================================================================

The css-scheme-builder project uses Semantic Versioning v2.0.0.

Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html> was created by Tom
Preston-Werner <http://tom.preston-werner.com/>, inventor of Gravatars and
cofounder of GitHub.

Version numbers take the form X.Y.Z where X is the major version, Y is
the minor version and Z is the patch version. The meaning of the
different levels are:

* Major version increases indicates that there is some kind of change in
  the API (how this program works as seen by the user) or the program
  features which is incompatible with previous version

* Minor version increases indicates that there is some kind of change in
  the API (how this program works as seen by the user) or the program
  features which might be new, while still being compatible with all other
  versions of the same major version

* Patch version increases indicate that there is some internal change,
  bug fixes, changes in logic, or other internal changes which do not
  create any incompatible changes within the same major version, and which
  do not add any features to the program operations or functionality
